# PayMongo Integration for LTO Enforcer App

## Overview
This implementation provides a custom PayMongo integration that avoids dependency conflicts by using direct HTTP calls instead of the outdated `paymongo_sdk` package.

## Files Created

### 1. `/lib/services/paymongo_service.dart`
- Core PayMongo API service
- Handles all PayMongo API calls using the `http` package
- Supports Payment Intents, Sources, and Payments
- Uses environment variables for API keys

### 2. `/lib/utils/payment_handler.dart`
- High-level payment processing logic
- Handles GCash, GrabPay, and Card payments
- Calculates amounts and formats data
- Provides user-friendly error handling

### 3. `/lib/pages/payment/index.dart`
- Complete payment UI
- Payment method selection
- Payment summary display
- Integration with PayMongo services

## Supported Payment Methods

### 1. GCash
- Creates a GCash source
- Redirects to GCash mobile app/website
- Returns to app after payment completion

### 2. GrabPay
- Creates a GrabPay source
- Redirects to GrabPay mobile app/website
- Returns to app after payment completion

### 3. Credit/Debit Cards
- Uses PayMongo Payment Intents
- Supports 3D Secure authentication
- Can be integrated with secure card forms

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env` file)
```
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY='pk_test_your_public_key_here'
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY='sk_test_your_secret_key_here'
```

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
url_launcher: ^6.2.6  # For opening payment URLs
```

## Usage Example

```dart
// Navigate to payment page
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PaymentPage(report: reportModel),
  ),
);
```

## API Methods Available

### PayMongoService
- `createPaymentIntent()` - For card payments
- `createPaymentMethod()` - Create payment method
- `attachPaymentMethod()` - Attach method to intent
- `getPaymentIntent()` - Check payment status
- `createSource()` - For wallet payments (GCash/GrabPay)
- `createPayment()` - Create payment using source

### PaymentHandler
- `processGCashPayment()` - Handle GCash payments
- `processGrabPayPayment()` - Handle GrabPay payments
- `processCardPayment()` - Handle card payments
- `checkPaymentStatus()` - Check payment status
- `calculateTotalAmount()` - Calculate violation total
- `formatAmount()` - Format PHP currency

## Security Features
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Basic authentication for API calls
- HTTPS-only communication
- Input validation and sanitization

## Testing
1. Replace the test API keys in `.env` with your PayMongo test keys
2. Test payments will not charge real money
3. Use PayMongo's test card numbers for card testing

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Replace test API keys with production keys
- [ ] Configure proper webhook handling
- [ ] Set up payment confirmation flow
- [ ] Implement proper error logging
- [ ] Add payment receipt generation
- [ ] Configure proper return URLs

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **No Dependency Conflicts** - Uses standard HTTP package
2. **Up-to-Date** - Direct API integration, always current
3. **Flexible** - Easy to modify and extend
4. **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns
5. **Secure** - Environment-based configuration

## Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors
- API errors
- User cancellation
- Payment failures
- Invalid responses

## Next Steps
1. Set up PayMongo test account and get API keys
2. Test payment flows with test data
3. Implement webhook handling for payment confirmations
4. Add payment history tracking in Firebase
5. Configure production environment
